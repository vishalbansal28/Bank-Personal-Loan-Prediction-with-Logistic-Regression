## Bank Personal Loan Prediction with Logistic Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook exploring the prediction of bank personal loan purchases using a Logistic Regression model. The project aims to analyze customer attributes and predict their likelihood of taking a personal loan.

**Dataset:**

The dataset used in this project is "Bank_Personal_Loan_Modelling-1.csv," containing information on 5000 customers with various attributes such as age, experience, income, credit card spending, and loan status. 



**Key Features:**

* **Data Exploration (EDA):** Comprehensive analysis of data distribution, missing values, and correlations between features using visualization tools.
* **Data Preparation:** Cleaning and preprocessing of the dataset, including one-hot encoding of categorical variables.
* **Logistic Regression Model:** Implementation of a Logistic Regression model to predict loan purchase likelihood.
* **Model Evaluation:**  Assessment of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* **Feature Importance:**  Exploration of the relative importance of different features in driving model predictions.

**Why Logistic Regression?**

Logistic Regression was chosen for this project due to its suitability for binary classification tasks. The model provides interpretability, simplicity, and reasonable handling of class imbalance, making it an appropriate choice for this analysis.

**Key Insights:**

* The analysis reveals the key factors influencing personal loan purchases, providing valuable insights for marketing strategies and customer targeting.
* The model's performance and limitations are discussed, highlighting opportunities for improvement.

**Further Exploration:**

* This project serves as a foundation for further exploration, including hyperparameter tuning, advanced class imbalance handling techniques, and the investigation of other machine learning models.
* The analysis can be extended by incorporating additional features, like demographics or credit history, to enhance the model's predictive power.
